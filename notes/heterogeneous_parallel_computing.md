# Heterogeneous Parallel Computing

HPC paradigms have shifted due to the eveloving GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures.


#### Parallel Computing

Parallel use of computing resources. IE: Divide a large problem into smaller pieces and split those computation arcoss various hardware elements (cores / computers)

NOTE: There is both a hardware architecture component and programming component in parallel programming.

```
                            ALU
                             |
Instruction Memory <--> Control Unint <--> Data Memory
                             |
                            I/O
```
HPC utilizes multiple cores on the CPU scaled out to N different machines.


#### Sequential and Parallel Programming
